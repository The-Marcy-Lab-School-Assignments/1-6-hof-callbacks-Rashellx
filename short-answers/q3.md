# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
The probelm with this code is that if you run this, it will give you a type error beacuse `printDouble` is being invoked with `()`. I fyou remove the `()` it will run.
