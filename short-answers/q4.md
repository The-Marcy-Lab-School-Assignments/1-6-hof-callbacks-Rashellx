# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
An "inline function" in JavaScript is a function defined within the scope of another function and created at runtime. It allows for the definition of functions that can be used on-the-fly without the need for a separate function declaration.Anonymous functions and "inline functions" are practically the same. The difference is that an "inline function" is assigned to a variable and so it can be reused.

### Example 
let func = function() { 
    //Code Here 
};

An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
