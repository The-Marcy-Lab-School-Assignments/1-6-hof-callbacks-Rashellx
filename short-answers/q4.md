# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
An "inline function" in JavaScript is a function defined within the scope of another function and created at runtime. It allows for the definition of functions that can be used on-the-fly without the need for a separate function declaration.Anonymous functions and "inline functions" are practically the same. The difference is that an "inline function" is assigned to a variable and so it can be reused.

### Example 
let func = function() { 
    //Your Code Here 
};
